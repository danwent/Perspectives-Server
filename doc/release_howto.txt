Developer note: here are the steps to release an update to the Perspectives Server software.


1. Local changes

- Commit, stash, or revert all of your in-progress changes
- Run the automated unit tests: 'python tests/unit_tests.py'
	- Can you add any tests for new features in this release?
- Run the manual tests (see the tests/ directory)
	- Can you add any tests for new features in this release?

Once you're confident everything works:

- Increment the VERSION number in notary_http.py, following the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format if possible
- If there are database schema changes that require data upgrades:
	- Create a new folder in doc/upgrades with the name '{old_verion_number}to{new_version_number}'
	- Inside that folder create a text file with the name 'upgrade_{old_verion_number}to{new_verion_number}.txt'
	- Document all steps required to upgrade a notary from the previous version to this version.
- Upload your changes to github
- Create a pull request to bring your changes to the main branch


2. Github

Once the pull requst has been approved:

- Add a tag in the official ('danwent') depo (if you're not a Perspectives maintainer, a maintainer will have to do this for you)
- Close any github tickets/issues fixed by the current release (bonus points: add them to the correct Milestone before closing!)


3. Broadcast

- Post to the Perspectives blog ( http://perspectives-project.org )
- Send an email to the mailing list ( https://groups.google.com/group/perspectives-dev
