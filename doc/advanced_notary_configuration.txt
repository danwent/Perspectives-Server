There are several options that can make your notary run even better.


1. Set up caching!

Data caching will significantly increase your notary's performance.

For best performance you may want to use a dedicated caching server such as memcached, memcachier, or redis. If you do not have access to or don't want to set up a dedicated caching server, use the built-in python caching with '--pycache'.


2. Enable SNI scanning

Using 'Server Name Indication' causes notaries to provide extra information when scanning sites - some sites require this to retrieve the correct SSL certificate.

Add the '--sni' argument to both your main notary server (notary_http.py) and your routine scanning job (e.g. scans done with notary_util/threaded_scanner.py). This will ensure the notary has the correct certificate for all sites.
