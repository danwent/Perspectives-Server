So you're upgrading to Perspectives Server version 3! Congratulations :) Here's how.


0. Install Prerequisites:

	a) Upgrade to python 2.7.

	http://www.python.org/getit/

	This is required for the 'argparse' module.


	b) Install sqlalchemy

	See http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/ru/latest/intro.html#installation-guide

	Depending on your system, you may be able to use something like

	>pip install SQLAlchemy

	sqlalchemy is used to talk to the database so we don't have hardcoded SQL strings.


1. Back up your database:

>cp notary.slqite notary.sqlite.backup2x

You can also use the db2file command from the next step.


2. Export your data using the special db2file_2to3.py module.

This module reads data from a 2.x database schema and exports it in the format expected by a 3.x database reader.

>python doc/upgrade2xto3x/db2file_2to3.py upgraded_data.txt


3. Rename your database

You can also specify a different database name when importing your data - perspectives will create the database and schema if they don't exist.

>mv notary.sqlite notary_2x.sqlite


4. Import your data

>python notary_util\file2db.py upgraded_data.txt


5. Check your settings

Many of the hardcoded settings from 2.0 have been converted to command-line arguments. Many of the required arguments have been given defaults. You can use the '-h' or '--help' switches to see the usage for each module - check how your old notary settings compare against the new settings and adjust anything you want to keep.

One of the biggest improvements with the 3.x notary is data caching. You may want to consider setting up a dedicated caching server or at least using the --pycache argument.


6. Run your server!

The command is now much shorter:

>python notary_http.py


7. You're done!

Congratulations, and enjoy the new features :)
