This directory contains step-by-step instructions on upgrading your Perspectives server from one version to another. If you are setting up a new server from scratch you can ignore all of this.



Upgrading a notary generally consists of two steps:
1) sync the new code
2) upgrade the database

Generally updating the code is simple (just 'git pull'), while upgrading the database may take several steps.

Each version increase is contained in its own sub-directory. If you are upgrading across multiple versions you will generally need to follow the instructions from each version increase. The exception is if you are upgrading a version 2.0 notary - you can simply follow one folder to upgrade to the highest version.

If you have questions or need help please contact us as described in the README! We are happy to help.
