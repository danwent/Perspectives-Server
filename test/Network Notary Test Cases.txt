Test cases for Perspectives Server code. Feel free to add more!

Each utility module can be unit-tested on its own as well.


- Does the server start up?
	- Even in a hosted environment where cherrypy can't rely on the PORT?
- Does it automatically create a private key if none exists?
- Does it connect to the database?
	- sqlite
	- postgresql
- Does it automatically create tables if none exist?


Arguments
---------
--webport and --envport
	- If neither is specifed do we use the default port?
	- If webport is specefied but is not an integer, does argparse reject it?
	- If webport is specified and is an integer, and no envport is given, do we use the webport?
	- If envport is specified but no environment variable by that name exists, do we log a warning and fall back to the default?
	- If envport is specified and the env var exists but is not an integer, do we throw a ValueError?
	- If envport is specified and the env var exists and is a valid integer, do we use it?
	- If both are specified, does argparse reject that usage?


While Running:
--------------
- If we get a request for an unknown service, does the server spawn a query process to ask about it?
	- Are the results properly reported back to the database?
- If we have data do we display the results?
	- Including multiple keys for a given service?
- If the visitor simply goes to the index do they get the HTML explanation page?
	- Are the public key and version number displayed?
	- Is the metric on/off status displayed on the page?
- If the service_type is unknown do they get a 404 error?
- Does the favicon work?
- If enabled, are metrics properly logged to the database for each type of event?
	- If enabled, are they properly printed to the log?


Database Connections:
---------------------
How to count connections for various database types:

	postgres:
		select numbackends from pg_stat_database WHERE datname = 'dbname'


- When retrieving observations for a known service, are the database connections properly closed afterward?
	- When scanning for a new service?


Failing Gracefully:
-------------------
- If the server can't connect to the database, does it still log an error and attempt to serve data from the cache?
	- Does the static index page still get created?
- If both the cache and database are unavailable will the server log errors, serve an HTTP 503 code, and keep running?
- Does the database fail gracefully if it does not have permission to create tables?
- Does the database fail gracefully if it does not have INSERT permission in the database? :
	- For Observations and Services, does it log an error and attempt to continue (instead of crashing)?
	- For Machines, and Event Types (on startup) does it log an error, disable database metrics, and continue?
	- For Metrics does it ignore the metric, log an error, and continue?
- Are metrics throttled back if the server receives many requests in a short period of time? (e.g. 200 requests per second)
